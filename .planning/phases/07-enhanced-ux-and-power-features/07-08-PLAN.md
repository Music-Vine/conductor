<objective>
Human verification checkpoint to confirm all Phase 7 features work correctly.

Purpose: Phase 7 adds four cross-cutting features (activity feed, inline editing, CSV export upgrades, tooltips) that affect the entire application. Human verification ensures these work together and nothing was broken.

Output: Verified confirmation that all Phase 7 success criteria are met, or a list of issues to address.

  <what-built>Complete Phase 7: Enhanced UX and Power Features — activity feed, inline editing, CSV export gap-fill, and contextual help tooltips.</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
  Start the dev server (`npm run dev`) and verify each feature area:

  **1. Activity Feed (Dashboard Widget)**
  - Navigate to the Dashboard (/)
  - Verify the activity feed widget shows ~10 recent entries
  - Each entry should show: actor name, action, entity name, relative time
  - Click an entry — should navigate to the entity detail page
  - Click "View all activity" — should navigate to /activity

  **2. Activity Feed (Full Page)**
  - Navigate to /activity (or use sidebar link)
  - Verify paginated activity entries are displayed
  - Use entity type filter (select "Assets") — only asset entries shown
  - Use entity search (enter an entity ID) — filtered to that entity
  - Verify pagination works across multiple pages
  - Go back to dashboard, click an entry — verify /activity loads with pre-filtered params

  **3. Inline Editing (Detail Pages)**
  - Navigate to any asset detail page — click the title text — it should become an input
  - Press Escape — value reverts to original
  - Click title again, change it, press Enter — toast shows "Saved", value updates
  - Repeat for: asset description, genre
  - Navigate to a contributor detail — verify name, email, phone are inline editable
  - Navigate to a payee detail — verify name, email, paymentMethod are inline editable
  - Navigate to a user detail — verify display name, username are inline editable
  - Verify email and status are NOT editable on users

  **4. Inline Editing (Table Rows)**
  - Navigate to the Assets list — click on an asset title IN the table
  - Verify it enters edit mode (not navigating to detail page)
  - Press Enter to save, verify toast and value update
  - Click on a non-editable column — verify it navigates to detail page (row click still works)
  - Repeat for Contributors, Payees, Users list tables (name column)

  **5. CSV Export (Existing — "Export All" Upgrade)**
  - Navigate to Users list — verify two export buttons: "Export filtered" and "Export all"
  - Click "Export filtered" — CSV downloads with current page data
  - Click "Export all" — button shows loading state, then CSV downloads with all data
  - Repeat verification on: Assets list, Contributors list, Payees list

  **6. CSV Export (New — Collections and Activity)**
  - Navigate to Collections — verify table view (not just card grid)
  - Verify "Export filtered" and "Export all" buttons exist
  - Export collections CSV — verify it contains id, title, platform, asset count, created date
  - Navigate to /activity — verify export buttons exist
  - Export activity CSV — verify it contains timestamp, actor, action, entity type, entity name, details

  **7. Contextual Help Tooltips**
  - Navigate to an asset detail page with workflow timeline
  - Verify ? icon appears next to workflow stage names (Initial Review, Quality Check, etc.)
  - Hover over ? icon — tooltip appears with 1-2 sentence explanation
  - Move mouse away — tooltip disappears
  - Navigate to a contributor detail page, Payees tab
  - Verify ? icon appears near payee percentage allocation
  - Hover shows explanation about 100% constraint

  **8. Cross-Feature Verification**
  - Verify the Activity sidebar link exists and works
  - Verify no console errors on any page
  - Verify existing features still work (search, filters, pagination, bulk operations)
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "approved" if all features work correctly, or describe any issues found.</resume-signal>

<success_criteria>
- All Phase 7 ROADMAP success criteria verified:
  1. Staff can export filtered/searched data to CSV from any data table
  2. Staff can use activity feed to see recent changes across the system
  3. Staff can edit common fields inline for quick updates without full edit forms
  4. Contextual help and tooltips guide staff through complex workflows
</success_criteria>
