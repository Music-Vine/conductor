<objective>
Create the feature parity audit checklist and decommission runbooks for all 4 legacy admin systems.

Purpose: Provide the operational documentation needed to validate Conductor covers all legacy workflows and to safely shut down each legacy system in sequence.
Output: 5 documentation files in `docs/decommission/`.

  <name>Task 1: Create feature parity audit checklist</name>
  <files>docs/decommission/feature-parity-audit.md</files>
  <action>
Create `docs/decommission/` directory and `feature-parity-audit.md`.

The audit checklist should be a structured markdown document that maps EVERY legacy workflow to its Conductor equivalent. Organize by legacy system, then by workflow category.

Structure:
```markdown
# Feature Parity Audit

**Status:** [ ] INCOMPLETE
**Auditor:** _______________
**Date:** _______________
**Sign-off:** Team Lead: _______________ Date: _______________

## How to Use This Checklist

For each legacy workflow listed below, verify that the equivalent Conductor feature:
1. Exists and is accessible from the navigation
2. Works with real data (not just mock data)
3. Produces the same outcome as the legacy system

Mark each item with [x] when verified. Add notes for any discrepancies.

## Gaps Identified

List any legacy workflows that have NO Conductor equivalent:

```

Make the Jordan's Admin and Retool sections have placeholder rows with instructions to fill in specific workflows during the audit process, since exact workflows for these systems are not fully documented in the project context.

Create 4 decommission runbooks, one for each legacy system. Each runbook follows the same structure but with system-specific details.

**Decommission order** (from CONTEXT.md):
1. Jordan's Admin (Secondary Uppbeat) -- lowest risk, first to go
2. Retool -- eliminates subscription cost
3. Music Vine PHP admin
4. Uppbeat PHP admin -- highest risk, last to go

Each runbook structure:
```markdown
# Decommission: [System Name]

**System:** [Name and description]
**Priority:** [N] of 4 (decommission order)
**Risk Level:** [Low/Medium/High]
**Owner:** _______________
**Status:** [ ] NOT STARTED

## Prerequisites

All prerequisites must be satisfied before decommission begins:

- [ ] Conductor is deployed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_REAL_API=true`
- [ ] Feature parity audit for [system] workflows is complete (see feature-parity-audit.md)
- [ ] Smoke tests pass against real data
- [ ] Staff UAT session completed for [system] workflows
- [ ] Team lead sign-off: _______________

## Pre-Decommission Checks

### Usage Verification
- [ ] Pull access logs for [system] (last 14 days)
- [ ] Confirm zero authenticated admin sessions for 5+ consecutive business days
- [ ] Log evidence saved: _______________

### Data Verification
- [ ] Verify Conductor displays same data as [system] for spot-check sample
- [ ] No data discrepancies reported by staff during parallel period

## Decommission Steps

### Step 1: Set Read-Only Mode
- [ ] [System-specific instructions for setting read-only]
- [ ] Notify all staff: "[System] is now read-only. Use Conductor for all write operations."
- [ ] Date set to read-only: _______________

### Step 2: Monitor Read-Only Period (5 business days)
- [ ] Day 1: Check access logs, note any usage
- [ ] Day 2: Check access logs
- [ ] Day 3: Check access logs
- [ ] Day 4: Check access logs
- [ ] Day 5: Check access logs — confirm zero or near-zero usage

### Step 3: Shut Down
- [ ] [System-specific shutdown instructions]
- [ ] DNS/routing updated (if applicable)
- [ ] Date shut down: _______________

### Step 4: Post-Shutdown Verification
- [ ] [System URL] returns 404/503 (not accessible)
- [ ] No staff reports of missing functionality (wait 48 hours)
- [ ] Decommission marked complete

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise after shutdown:
- [ ] [System-specific restart instructions]
- [ ] Flip Conductor `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_REAL_API=false` to restore mock mode (if needed)

## Notes

(Space for operational notes during decommission)
```

**System-specific details:**

**jordans-admin.md (Jordan's Admin / Secondary Uppbeat):**
- Risk Level: Low (fewest users, most contained scope)
- Read-only instructions: "Disable write endpoints in the application config" or "Remove staff credentials"
- Shutdown: "Stop the application server / disable the deployment"
- Note: "Also known as 'Secondary Uppbeat PHP/JS admin'. Has unique features but no team interest in supporting."

**retool.md (Retool Admin):**
- Risk Level: Low (UI tool only, no auth dependency on other systems)
- Read-only instructions: "Set all Retool apps to read-only mode in Retool admin settings"
- Shutdown: "Remove all apps from Retool workspace"
- Additional step: "Cancel Retool subscription (cost savings)"
- Include subscription cancellation checklist item

**musicvine-php.md (Music Vine PHP Admin):**
- Risk Level: High (primary platform admin, longest-running system)
- Read-only instructions: "Set application to maintenance mode / disable write routes"
- Shutdown: "Stop the PHP application server, update nginx config to return 503"
- Note: "This is the primary platform. Extra caution warranted."

**uppbeat-php.md (Uppbeat PHP Admin):**
- Risk Level: High (serves the largest platform by user count)
- Read-only instructions: "Set application to maintenance mode / disable write routes"
- Shutdown: "Stop the PHP application server, update nginx config to return 503"
- Note: "Last to decommission. 90%+ of staff dev time was on this platform."
