<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <what-built>Complete payee and contributor management system covering all 5 PAYE requirements: contributor CRUD, payee CRUD, many-to-many relationship management with percentage rates, relationship viewing with filtering, and CSV export for accounting.</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
Start the dev server (`npm run dev`) and test the following scenarios:

**Scenario 1: Contributor List (PAYE-04)**
1. Click "Contributors" in sidebar navigation
2. Verify table shows contributors with Name, Status, Assets, Payees, Created columns
3. Search for "Alex" - verify results filter
4. Change status filter to "Active" - verify filter applies
5. Verify pagination works if results exceed page size

**Scenario 2: Add New Contributor (PAYE-01)**
1. Click "Add Contributor" button on contributors list page
2. Try submitting empty form - verify validation errors appear
3. Fill in Name and Email, submit
4. Verify success toast and redirect to new contributor detail

**Scenario 3: Contributor Detail & Profile**
1. Click on a contributor in the list (e.g., contrib-001)
2. Verify Profile tab shows: Name, Email, Phone, masked Tax ID, Address, Status, dates
3. Verify status badge colors (active=green, inactive=red, pending=yellow)

**Scenario 4: Payee Assignments (PAYE-02, PAYE-03)**
1. On contributor detail, click "Payees" tab
2. Verify payee table shows assigned payees with percentage rates
3. Verify total rate summary shows 100% in green
4. Click "Edit Assignments" or "Add Payee"
5. Verify form shows existing payees pre-filled
6. Change a rate - verify total updates in real-time
7. Try setting rates that don't sum to 100% - verify submit is disabled
8. Set valid rates (sum to 100%) - verify submit is enabled
9. Submit - verify success and data refreshes

**Scenario 5: Payee List & Detail (PAYE-04)**
1. Click "Payees" in sidebar
2. Verify table shows payees with Name, Payment Method, Status, Contributors columns
3. Search for a payee name - verify results filter
4. Filter by payment method - verify filter works
5. Click a payee to view detail

7. Click Contributors tab - verify associated contributors shown with rates

**Scenario 6: CSV Export (PAYE-05)**
1. On Contributors list, click "Export CSV"
2. Verify CSV file downloads with contributor data
3. On Payees list, click "Export CSV"
4. Verify CSV file downloads with payee data
5. Open downloaded files and verify column headers are correct

**Scenario 7: Global Search Integration**
1. Press Cmd+K to open command palette
2. Type "Alex" - verify contributor results appear
3. Click a contributor result - verify navigation to detail page
4. Search for a payee name - verify payee results appear

**Scenario 8: Navigation**
1. Verify Contributors and Payees appear in sidebar with appropriate icons
2. Verify "Back to Contributors" / "Back to Payees" links work from detail pages
3. Verify tab state persists in URL (refresh page on Payees tab - should stay on Payees tab)
